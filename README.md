Welcome to my final submission for the "Menjadi Front-End Web Developer Expert" course on Dicoding! This project showcases a restaurant website landing page that helps users discover popular restaurants nearby, allowing them to search for restaurants, bookmark their favorites, and even access the website in offline mode through its Progressive Web App (PWA) implementation. The project demonstrates my proficiency in various cutting-edge web technologies including Webpack, Workbox, PWA features, IndexedDB, Web Components, Sharp, SASS, and Vanilla JS, and includes comprehensive End-to-End (E2E) testing to ensure a polished user experience.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly restaurant finder website that employs a variety of modern technologies to deliver a seamless and engaging experience. Users can explore nearby restaurants, search for specific cuisines, and conveniently bookmark their preferred choices. The PWA aspect of the project ensures that users can still access the website even when they're offline, maintaining a smooth experience regardless of connectivity.

## Features

- **Restaurant Search**: Users can search for nearby restaurants based on location, cuisine type, or user ratings.

- **Bookmarking**: The bookmark feature allows users to save their favorite restaurants for quick access.

- **Offline Access**: The PWA implementation enables users to access the website even without an internet connection. Key assets and data are cached using Workbox to ensure a responsive offline experience.

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive, providing a consistent and visually appealing experience across different devices.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- **Webpack**: Bundles and manages project assets, optimizing performance and modularity.

- **Workbox**: Enables the implementation of service workers to facilitate PWA features, including asset caching and offline access.

- **PWA (Progressive Web App)**: Utilizes modern web capabilities to provide an app-like experience, including offline functionality and push notifications.

- **IndexedDB**: Stores bookmarked restaurants locally, allowing offline access to saved content.

- **Web Components**: Constructs reusable, encapsulated UI components, enhancing code maintainability and readability.

- **Sharp**: Optimizes and resizes images for improved loading times.

- **SASS**: Utilizes the SASS preprocessor for organized and maintainable CSS.

- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Develops JavaScript functionalities without relying on external frameworks, ensuring efficiency.

- **End-to-end Testing**: Implements comprehensive E2E testing to verify the functionality and integrity of the project.
